Hidden Markov Model
===================

There are two important aspects to the HMM model in our project

* `Hidden Markov Model: Likelihood computation`_
* `Decoding: Viterbi Algorithm`_

But if you are interested in understading the integration of the model in the framework and reproduciblity, please refer to the following

* `Model architecture`_
* `Results on different datasets`_

Hidden Markov Model: Likelihood computation
*******************************************

A detailed documentation and notes on Hidden Markov Model could be found at https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/A.pdf

See the following video a visual representation of how the HMM works.

Decoding: Viterbi Algorithm
